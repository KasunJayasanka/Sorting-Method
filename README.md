# Sorting-Method
This repository has been created to submit in Major League Hack - MLH  Resources

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for the Sorting Method project stemmed from the constant need for efficient data organization and the desire to explore and implement innovative sorting algorithms.

## What it does
Sorting Method is a project designed to streamline the chaos in data by providing a versatile and efficient sorting solution. It leverages advanced sorting algorithms to organize lists, offering a reliable tool for data management.
```
void main() {
  // Sample list
  List<int> myNumbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 6];

  // Sorting the list without using inbuilt functions
  myNumbers = customSort(myNumbers);

  // Displaying the sorted list
  print("Original List: $myNumbers");
}

List<int> customSort(List<int> list) {
  int n = list.length;

  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (list[j] > list[j + 1]) {
        // swapping elements if they are in the wrong order
        int temp = list[j];
        list[j] = list[j + 1];
        list[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }

  return list;
}

```

## How we built it
The project was built using a combination of programming languages, focusing on versatility and performance. We carefully implemented various sorting algorithms and optimized the code to ensure seamless integration and fast execution.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development process, we faced challenges such as algorithmic complexities, optimization hurdles, and integration issues. Overcoming these obstacles required teamwork, problem-solving, and a commitment to delivering a robust solution.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in achieving a well-optimized and effective sorting solution. Our accomplishment lies in creating a tool that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of efficiency and reliability in data sorting.

## What we learned
The project provided valuable insights into the nuances of sorting algorithms, optimization techniques, and collaborative development. We honed our skills in algorithm design, coding practices, and project management.

## What's next for Sorting Method
Looking ahead, we plan to expand the Sorting Method project by incorporating additional sorting algorithms, enhancing user interface features, and exploring integration possibilities with other applications. We aim to continuously improve and adapt to meet the evolving needs of data management and organization.
